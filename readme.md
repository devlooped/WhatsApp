## License

We offer this project under a dual licensing model, tailored to the needs 
of commercial distributors and open-source projects.

For open-source projects and free software developers:  
If you develop free software (FOSS) and want to leverage this project, 
the open-source version under AGPLv3 is ideal. 
If you use a FOSS license other than AGPLv3, Devlooped offers an exception, 
allowing usage without requiring the entire derivative work to fall under 
AGPLv3, under certain conditions.

See [AGPLv3](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3) and 
[Universal FOSS Exception](https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/universal-foss-exception/).

For OEMs, ISVs, VARs, and other commercial application distributors:  
If you combine this project and distribute commercial software without 
sharing the code under AGPLv3, you must obtain a commercial license from 
[Devlooped](mailto:hello@devlooped.com).
